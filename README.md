# On-the-tipping-points-of-Bernoulli-s-inequality

The project is an article concerning Bernoulli's inequality.
It contains a proof in English of an old result that was originally published in Bulgarian by N. Hadžiivanov and I. Prodanov.
Their paper appeared in 1965 in "Fiz.-Mat. Spis. Bǔlgar. Akad. Nauk." (?) and seems long lost.
However, the result is cited in at least two books and two articles.
