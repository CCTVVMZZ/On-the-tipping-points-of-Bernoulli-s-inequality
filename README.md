# On-the-tipping-points-of-Bernoulli-s-inequality

The project is an article concerning Bernoulli's inequality.
It contains a proof in English of the following old result: 
For each odd integer n > 3, the unique non-zero real root of the polynomial (1 + x)^n - 1 - n x is less than - 2 - 1 / (n - 2) and increases with n.
The orginal proof was written in Bulgarian by N. Hadžiivanov and I. Prodanov.
Their paper appeared in 1965 in "Fiz.-Mat. Spis. Bǔlgar. Akad. Nauk." (?) and seems long lost.
However, the considered result is cited in at least two books and two articles.
